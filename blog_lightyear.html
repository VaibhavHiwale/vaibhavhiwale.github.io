                <h2 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7"><em>30th July 2022</em></h2>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since I was a child, the world of automobiles has held a mesmerising sway over me. The sheer power of engines, the body's aerodynamics, the genius of engineers, and the captivating stories accompanying them have always ignited my passion. Among the myriad of automotive wonders, Lightyear cars have managed to captivate me with their innovative use of battery and solar energy for propulsion.<br><br>Lightyear, originally a student-led competition team from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), transitioned into a groundbreaking commercial venture. 2019 I first encountered Lightyear when the founders unveiled their prototype, the Lightyear One. This remarkable vehicle stands apart by not solely relying on conventional batteries but also harnessing the boundless power of solar energy. Its ingenious curved solar panel, encompassing the maximum surface area, adeptly captures sunlight, making it a highly efficient energy source. Through Lightyear, I found myself fascinated by the concept of solar electric vehicles. And after three long years, in 2022, I had the extraordinary opportunity to witness these exceptional vehicles in person.<br><br>July 25th marked the culmination of a bustling schedule at the European Hyperloop Week, finally granting me a respite to explore the country at my own pace. While I relish the freedom of solo travel, I've come to recognise the value of expert advice to ensure I take advantage of the hidden gems. This time was no exception. Visiting Lightyear's renowned research and development centre sat atop my priority list. Yet, the chaotic nature of my preparations caused me to forget the essential step of requesting permission in advance. With two days remaining before my flight back to Bangalore, I turned to the virtual realm and reached out to Lightyear employees via LinkedIn. Despite Engin Senol being on vacation, his gracious response and redirecting my request to the HR department instilled hope. However, as the day wore on, my inbox remained empty, devoid of a reaction from Lightyear's HR team. Time was slipping through my fingers, and with no other options, I resolved to take a bold, unconventional move to visit the office unannounced. Admittedly, such behaviour could be deemed unprofessional, but my relentless curiosity and unwavering love for technology urged me forward, dismissing any qualms about propriety.<br><br>One day before departing for India, I boarded the morning sprinter train from Delft, my heart excited to witness Lightyear's remarkable creations up close. After traversing approximately 140 kilometres, I found myself in the serene town of Helmond 't Hout, basking in its tranquil atmosphere within two hours. A profound sense of peace washed over me the moment I set foot in Helmond. The air bore a gentle breeze, whispered melodies from the birds filled my ears, and the landscape unfolded before my eyes, showcasing elegant houses enveloped in lush greenery. A leisurely stroll brought me to the coveted destinationâ€”the Automotive Campus. Filled with confidence, I crossed the threshold of the headquarters, warmly greeted the receptionist, and initiated a conversation. With enthusiasm coursing through my veins, I shared my deep desire to embark on a research and development centre tour. The receptionist's bemused expression, etched into my memory, elicited a chuckle as she tried to comprehend the audacity of my request. Inquisitively, she probed for any appointments, meticulously scanning the calendar for overlooked entries, only to find a void awaiting her. Transparently, I explained my predicament and humbly beseeched her to make an exception for my unconventional demand. Ever so diligently, she notified the staff present and<br><br> Kindly request my patience while they consider my appeal. I couldn't help but admire her earnest efforts as she explored every avenue, even going so far as to personally confer with the on-site employees.<br><br>Meanwhile, I contacted Pranesh Dewangan, an esteemed alumnus of IIT Madras, to inquire whether he could guide me through the Lightyear premises. Regrettably, fate had conspired against us, and he worked from home that day. Reflecting on the situation, I couldn't help but acknowledge my oversight in neglecting to notify him of my impending visit. As time passed, my anticipation mingled with apprehension until a figure approached, curiosity etched across his face. Engaging me in conversation, he introduced himself as Eric Rutten. Gratitude surged within me for this generous individual who, despite a demanding schedule, had set aside time to provide me with a brief tour of the factory. I was awestruck as I reached out and touched a Lightyear vehicle, feeling its sleek exterior and stepping into its inviting interior. Drawing upon his expertise in electrical engineering, Eric eloquently unveiled the inner workings of the Lightyear, and I attentively recorded every nugget of wisdom he shared. It was a privilege to witness the evolution of solar cells and electric motors, marvel at the meticulously designed chassis, and delve into battery pack design and development.<br><br>At that moment, my dreams became a tangible reality. The visit enriched my technical knowledge and offered invaluable insights into the culture and operations of product-based startups. I forged indelible memories and connected with brilliant, humble minds devoted to pushing the boundaries of innovation.<br><br>As I embark on this journey of growth and discovery, I find myself still perfecting the art of posingâ€”a mere reflection of the ongoing quest to capture the essence of these remarkable experiences.</p>
